                        in beautiful and quiet Wears Valley. This cabin gives you the delight of gorgeous mountain and valley views, close proximity to the Great
                        Smoky Mountain National Park, yet is still a short drive to both Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg. Wireless internet is available in the cabin
                        to keep you connected to the rest of the world. Each room is exquisite: there are large closets, spacious bathrooms, comfortable beds,
                        and exceptional amenities. Open the glass doors and behold the breathtaking views of the Great Smoky Mountains. You'll love the huge

                        including rockers, so you can relax and enjoy the mountain and valley views. The full glass double front doors, as well as vaulted ceiling,

                        and contains a flat top range, double sinks with garbage disposal, as well as beautiful granite counter tops. The dining area has a
